# Sequencer-Parser-Java-
A Simple Parser (made for the major project "Sequencer") 

This simple and easy paraser that is used in the bigger project works with information that is encoded inside the query string.
To decode we need to parse information out of the query string.

The String called "CommandoX" represents the query string.

The programm parses the needed information out of "CommandoX" and saves it inside the String Array "Echo".

By accessing the Array we go further and do more.
